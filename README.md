Traing image Selection with CNN

This procedure can achieve TI selected precision test, the output file is output.log. 
By default, there are 4 examples of data. If you need to do custom testing, please modify 
the example section of the code in the TI_Selection.cs file.

If you are only doing training image selection, change yourself to the training image and 
test file, and then run the Tensorflow_ImageClassification project.
 
Note: Before running, both projects (TensorFlow_ImageClassification & ti_selection_CNN) 
need to be compiled.
